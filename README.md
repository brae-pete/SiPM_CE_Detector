# SiPM_CE_Detector
Open Source Fluorescence Detector for Capillary Electrophoresis. 

Included here is the KiCAD project folder, gerber files for PCB fabrication, STL files for 3D printed detector housing, an example electropherogram, and a jupyter notebook highlighting the data analysis. The project file 'Redraw' can be opened to view the circuit schematic. There are 2 PCB layout files, one for the 3 mm and one for the 6 mm sensor.
