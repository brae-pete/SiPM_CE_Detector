# SiPM Fluorescence Detector
Open Source Fluorescence Detector thas was applied for Capillary Electrophoresis. We noticed there was very little performance difference between the SiPM and the PMT when used in an epi-illumination setup. 

Included here is the KiCAD project folder, gerber files for PCB fabrication, STL files for 3D printed detector housing, list of materials for the circuit, an example electropherogram, and a jupyter notebook highlighting the data analysis. The project file 'Redraw' can be opened to view the circuit schematic. There are 2 PCB layout files, one for the 3 mm and one for the 6 mm sensor.
